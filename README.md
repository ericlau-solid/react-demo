# React Showcase

Meant to showcase my abilities with React / Redux.

Uses [**React Static Boilerplate**](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate). Please read the project's readme for installation instructions.

Notes:

* gravatar ui built to showcase redux
* using airbnb linting rules (not necessarily reflect my preferences)
* read readme.md file before starting - some software requirements and instructions on launching
